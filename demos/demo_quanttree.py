"""
In this demo, we demonstrate the usage of QuantTree [1] and illustrate the parameters that can be customized.

The stationary distribution is a 0-mean Gaussian distribution with a random covariance matrix.
The post-change distribution is a Gaussian distribution with fixed Kullback-Leibler distance to the stationary one,
generated using the Controlled Change Magnitude (CCM) framework [2].

The QuantTree histogram is constructed over `N` samples drawn from the stationary distribution.
During training, QuantTree computes a threshold set to achieve a False Positive Rate (FPR) of `alpha`.
After training, we generate `nbatches` stationary and `nbatches` post-change batches and compute the QuantTree test
statistic of choice. We detect those batches whose statistic exceeds the detection threshold computed during training.

We report the FPR and TPR achieved by the QuantTree.

Parameters
----------
dim : int
    The data dimension
K : int
    The number of bins constructed by the QuantTree algorithm
N : int
    The number of training samples drawn from the stationary distribution
nu : int
    The number of samples per batch in the considered batch-wise scenario
alpha : float
    The desired percentage of false positives
statistic_name : {"pearson", "tv"}
    The statistic of choice (Pearson or Total Variation)
threshold_method : {"quanttree", "dirichlet"}
    The employed threshold computation strategy.
        "quanttree" uses the Monte Carlo simulations illustrated in the original paper [1]
        "dirichlet" uses the efficient strategy proposed in [3]
target_sKL : float
    The symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance between the stationary and post-change distributions
nbatches : int
    The number of stationary/post-change batches generated for testing
transf_type : {"none", "pca"}
    The transformation applied to preprocess the data.
        "none" means that no preprocessing is adopted
        "pca" menas that a PCA-transformation is fitted to the training data and used as preprocessing
